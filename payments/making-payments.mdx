### Making Your Payment

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Find a Project:</strong> Browse and select a project to support
    using our search tool. You can search for any GitHub project and choose the
    one you’re passionate about.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Complete Payment:</strong> Click the "Fund" button on the selected
    repository and follow the prompts to make a payment. You can also choose to
    time lock your funds to encourage specific use, such as issue bounties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Receive a confirmation of your payment and
    support.
  </li>
</ol>

### How It Works

When you fund a project through GitPaid:

<ul>
  <li>
    The repository owner receives an email alert to connect their repo to
    GitPaid to access the funds.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can time lock your payment to incentivise specific uses, such as funding
    issue bounties.
  </li>
  <li>
    The funds are securely held until the repository owner is ready to use them.
  </li>
</ul>

GitPaid makes it simple and transparent to support the open-source projects you care about. Let’s get started and make a difference together!
