## Link your Github account

Next up is to connect your Github account by clicking "Link your Github account" on your dashboard.

We require this step only to

<ul>
  <li>Verify your Github identity</li>
  <li>Display public information about you</li>
  <li>Manage the Gitpaid App</li>
</ul>

## Connect your wallet

Gitpaid uses the [coinbase smart wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/wallet/smart-wallet).

This allows us to:

<ul>
  <li>Quick & simple to integrate</li>
  <li>Easy onboarding</li>
  <li>Gasless transaction</li>
</ul>

## Link wallet

By linking your wallet it will be used to receive funds for the work you complete or to fund other repositories on the platform.

## Import Repositories

Now youâ€™re all set to import repositories for funding or incentives on GitPaid.

**_Note: We currently support public repositories only._**
