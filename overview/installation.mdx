## Link your Github account

Next up is to connect your Github account by clicking "Get Started".

We require this step only to

<ul>
  <li>Verify your Github identity</li>
  <li>Display public information about you</li>
  <li>Manage the Gitpaid App</li>
</ul>

## Connect your wallet

Gitpaid uses the [Coinbase smart wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/wallet/smart-wallet).

This allows us to:

<ul>
  <li>Integration with Coinbase for on/off ramping</li>
  <li>Offer a secure and easy to use wallet</li>
  <li>Utilize Gasless transactions</li>
</ul>

## Link wallet

By linking your wallet it will be used to receive funds for the work you complete or to fund other repositories on the platform.

## Import Repositories

Now youâ€™re all set to import repositories for funding or to receive funding.

**_Note: We currently support public repositories only._**
