## Allocating Funds

### Using GitHub Tags to Allocate Funds

Allocating funds is seamlessly integrated with GitHub tags. For example, if you have $10 USDC in your repository, you can add a $10 tag to a GitHub issue. Hereâ€™s how:

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Create a Tag:</strong> On your GitHub repository, create a new tag
    with the amount you want to allocate (e.g., $10).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assign the Tag:</strong> Add the tag to the relevant issue or pull
    request.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Notify Contributors:</strong> Inform your contributors that funds
    have been allocated to their work.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor Allocations:</strong> Track all allocations through your
    GitPaid dashboard to ensure transparency and proper distribution.
  </li>
</ol>
