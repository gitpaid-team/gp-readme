## Fund a repository

You can fund a repository directly via the repository card in your _Profile_ by clicking the fund button. When you fund a repository the funds can then be used by the repository owner to create individual issue bounties via Github labels.

<ul>
  <li>Select the amount you would like to fund, including token type.</li>
  <li>Choose the time period you would like your funds to be locked until.</li>
</ul>

Once a repository has been funded, the repository owner or maintainers can create [Github Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) that map to a token amount and type. For example, if you have funded a repository for 200 USDC via Gitpaid, then a label with any amount < 200 USDC can be created and assigned to an issue on Github. Once the issue is solved, the solver will automatically be paid the amount on the label.

## Funding Lock Periods

Funding a repository requires the funding user to define a "Token Unlock Date". Once the date elapses, the repository owner will be able to withdraw the locked amount of tokens from the repository. You can think of this as a _delayed donation_. Rather than allowing the user to withdraw the funds right away, the funds are locked until a certain date. During the lock time, the funds are still able to be utilized via the standard process of issues being solved and solvers being paid.
