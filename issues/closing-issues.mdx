When an issue is closed on Github an event is sent to the Gitpaid platform via a webhook. When this event is received, Gitpaid checks the resolver of the issue and, if they have an active wallet registered on the platform. If so, the platform will pay the allocated amount on the Github Label to the solvers wallet address on Base. It will do this by utilizing the funds that have been allocated to a repository via the [funding](../repositories/funding.mdx) flow.

Issues must be [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-or-branch-to-an-issue-using-the-issue-sidebar) to a pull request **before or as the pull request is being merged** for the Gitpaid platform to know that it must issue a payment.
