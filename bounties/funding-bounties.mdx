## Fund a repository

You can fund a repository directly via the repository card by clicking the fund button. When you fund a repository the funds can then be used to create individual issue bounties.

<ul>
  <li>Select the amount you would like to fund, including token type.</li>
  <li>Choose the time period you would like your funds to unlock by. </li>
</ul>

## Funding an issue bounty

Gitpaid allows you to create bounties directly on issues within Github utlising the label system.
To create a bounty on Github, navigate to an issue and add a label for the bounty amount.

For example you can create a 150usdc bounty by adding the label, the funds will be withdrawn from the amount that has been funded to the repo.
